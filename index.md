I am pursuing a Master's in Machine Learning at University College London.

Previously, I worked as a Full-Stack Machine Learning Engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://juliahub.com/">JuliaHub</a> (formerly Julia Computing) for 3 years. I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a> with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science in 2021. 

I love contributing to open source. I helped build <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses">JuliaGaussianProcesses</a>. I have also previously worked on Turing.jl - a generative probabilistic programming framework and PyMC3 - another Python equivalent.

In a past life, I was a Visiting Student at MIT's <a target="_blank" href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/">Probabilistic Computing Project</a> under [Prof Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/){:target="_blank"}, worked on Model Compression techniques during my undergraduate research at BITS under <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=zpNTeogAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof Ashwin Srinivasan</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tirtharajdash.github.io/">Tirtharaj Dash</a>, and spent a summer at Inria with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.julyanarbel.com">Prof Julyan Arbel</a> researching Uncertainty Quantification in Bayesian Neural Networks.

Check out my [research](./research.html){:target="_blank"} and [open source](./open_source.html){:target="_blank"} contributions.

I am currently looking for interesting products to work on. Hit me up on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharanry/) or [email](mailto:sharan.yalburgi.24@ucl.ac.uk) if you want to chat.
