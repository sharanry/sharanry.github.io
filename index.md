Hi! I am Sharan Yalburgi, I work as Research Enginner at <a target="_blank" href="https://juliahub.com/">JuliaHub</a> (formerly Julia Computing). I graduated from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani</a> with degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science. 

Previously, I was a Visiting Student at MIT's <a target="_blank" href="http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/">Probabilistic Computing Project</a> under the supervision of [Prof Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/){:target="_blank"}. I am working on benchmarking various inference strategies and unlocking Gen's programmable inference for Stan programs.

I love contributing to open source. I am helped build <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses">JuliaGaussianProcesses</a> under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/hong/">Dr Hong Ge</a>, University of Cambridge. We aim for this to be a complete Gaussian Processes framework in Julia ecosystem.

My undergraduate research supervision at BITS was by <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=zpNTeogAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof Ashwin Srinivasan</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://tirtharajdash.github.io/">Tirtharaj Dash</a> where I primarily worked on Model Compression techniques. I also did a reading course on Statistial Learning Theory.

I spent a summer at Inria working under the guidance of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.julyanarbel.com">Prof Julyan Arbel</a> where I worked on Uncertainity Quatification in Bayesian Neural Networks.
