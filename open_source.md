  - I have contributed to various packages in the ecosystem including LinearSolve.jl, SciMLBase.jl, Integrals.jl and ModelingToolkit.jl.
- [JuliaGaussianProcesses](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/){:target="_blank"} -  Gaussian Processes ecosystem in Julia 
  - [AbstractGPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/AbstractGPs.jl){:target="_blank"} -  Abstract types and methods for Gaussian Processes. 
  - [KernelFunctions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGaussianProcesses/KernelFunctions.jl){:target="_blank"} -  Julia package for kernel functions for machine learning 

- [Bijectors.jl](https://github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl/){:target="_blank"} -  Implementation of normalising flows and constrained random variable transformations
